# Authentication Implementation - Blurr HR Management Portal

## Requirements
- User authentication with email/password
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Secure password handling

## Implementation Details

### NextAuth Configuration
- Using NextAuth.js with Credentials provider
- JWT session strategy for stateless authentication
- Custom pages for login and registration

### User Roles
- ADMIN: Full access to all features
- MANAGER: Access to project management, limited employee data
- EMPLOYEE: Access to assigned tasks and personal information

### Authorization Strategy
- Created middleware to check user roles for protected routes
- Server-side validation in server actions
- Client-side conditional rendering of UI elements

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- CSRF protection with NextAuth
- Input validation with Zod

## Future Enhancements
- Consider adding OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Implement two-factor authentication
- Add session management features (force logout, session listing)
